Hello, I am @CallumRodgers! I'm a 16 year old developer who
wants to bring modern science software to those who might not have
great resources, and to everyone who aspires to learn.

I am mostly an amateur Java programmer--all I know came from self-teaching--, 
although I learned a tiny bit of HTML, CSS and Python, but nothing remarkable.
So it's best to keep that in mind haha.

I really enjoy programming, love classical music (I'm a pianist and composer), and
you will also find me often times writing books and experimenting with photography!

In the moment, I'm learning Japanese (also want to start German sometime soon), 
and trying to deepen my knowledge in Java. 

You can get in touch with me by this e-mail: callumrodgers.business@gmail.com
